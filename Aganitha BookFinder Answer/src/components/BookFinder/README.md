# Book Finder App

## Overview:

The **Book Finder App** is a web-based application that allows users to search for books by title. It fetches book details from the Open Library API and displays them to users. The app helps users find books, view detailed information like authors, publishers, and publication year. It also handles loading states and errors gracefully.

## Features:

- **Search Books by Title**: Users can search for books by entering a title in the search bar.
- **Book Information Display**: Displays the title, author(s), publisher, publication year, and ISBN of the books found.
- **Error Handling**: Shows an error message if no books are found or if there is an issue with the search.
- **Loading Spinner**: A loading spinner is shown while the data is being fetched from the API.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and works well on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Technology Stack:

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and creating a user-friendly design.
- **Open Library API**: To fetch book details based on the search query.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For handling the app’s logic, including fetching data, handling user input, and updating the UI.

## How to Develop:

1. **Set up the Project**:
   - Create a new React app using `create-react-app`.
   - Set up the directory structure with components like `BookFinder`.
   - Add the necessary CSS for styling.
2. **Manage State**:

   - Use React's `state` to manage the books, query input, loading, and error states.
   - Add event handlers to update the state when the user types in the search bar or clicks the search button.

3. **Fetch Data from API**:

   - In the `searchBooks` function, use `fetch` to send a request to the Open Library API.
   - Parse the response to JSON and store the results in the state.

4. **Handle User Input**:

   - Add an input field where users can type the book title.
   - Use the `handleInputChange` function to update the state with the user’s query.

5. **Conditional Rendering**:

   - Use conditional rendering to display the list of books, the error message, or the loading spinner based on the current state.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Display an error message if the API returns no results or if there is an issue with the fetch request.

## Mobile Approach:

1. **Responsive Design**:
   - Use media queries to make the app responsive on mobile devices. Ensure that the search bar, buttons, and book details are properly displayed on smaller screens.
2. **Touch Interactions**:

   - Ensure that the app is touch-friendly by making buttons easy to click on mobile devices.

3. **Test Mobile Layout**:
   - Test the app on multiple devices to ensure that the layout and functionality work well on both Android and iOS devices.

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the app using `npm start`.
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the app.

## Deployment:

- The app can be deployed to platforms like **Netlify** or **Vercel** for free hosting. Simply connect the GitHub repository and deploy it.
